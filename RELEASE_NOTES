Apache Trinidad is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache MyFaces PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until
a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status
is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that
the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
