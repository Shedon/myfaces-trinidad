ADF Faces Status


PROJECT STATUS
==============

  The ADF Faces project represents the incubation of a comprehensive library
  of JavaServer Faces components. The intended destination of this project
  is the existing Apache MyFaces project.

  Note that ADF Faces is a temporary working name for the incubation of the
  corresponding code and committers. The final name of the component library
  will be chosen by the MyFaces developer community, in the usual Apache fashion.
