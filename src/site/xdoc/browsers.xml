<p>Trinidad is currently supported on the following user agents.  We'd very
much like to add additional platforms to this list -  omission doesn't
mean it that it doesn't work, just that it hasn't been tested.
(NOTE: PDA support is definitely longer than just this list -
Blackberry support was recently added.  A separate table of 
PDA support should be added once that's been gathered.) </p>
