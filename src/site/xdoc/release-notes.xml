      <section name="Overview">
        <p>This is the first release of Apache MyFaces Trinidad since
leaving the incubator.  The highlight of this release is greatly
improved client-side validation, now using inline DHTML instead of
Javascript alerts, as provided by Danny Robinson.  Many bugs
have been fixed.  See below for the full list.
       </p>
      </section>
      <section name="Release Notes">
<subsection name="Features">

<ul>
<li>Client-side validation no longer shows Javascript alerts.  Instead,
error messages are shown inline on the components.  This can
be overridden (to use alerts or disable altogether) using a
new &lt;client-validation&gt; element in trinidad-config.xml.
Thanks to Danny Robinson for this feature.
</li>

<li>A new "autoSubmit" attribute on table and treeTable will send
PPR submissions to the server any time a row is selected.</li>

<li>"autoSubmit" now works inside of a subform.</li>

<li>.css skinning files can now be edited live without rebooting the server.</li>

<li>The labelAndAccessKey and textAndAccessKey attribute are supported in Facelets</li>
</ul>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Changes from previous release">
  <ul>
  <li>The skin selector names for tr:messages have been slightly modified for consistency, and added flexibility. 
      Refer to the <a href="skin-selectors.html">Skinning Guide</a> for more information</li>

<section name="Supported Platforms">


<p>Trinidad is currently supported on the following user agents.  We'd very
much like to add additional platforms to this list -  omission doesn't
mean it that it doesn't work, just that it hasn't been tested.
(NOTE: PDA support is definitely longer than just this list -
Blackberry support was recently added.  A separate table of 
PDA support should be added once that's been gathered.) </p>
