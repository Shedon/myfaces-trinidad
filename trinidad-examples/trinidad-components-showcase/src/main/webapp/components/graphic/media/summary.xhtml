    The media component displays media content, such as audio, video, or image in a player 
    embedded in the user agent. The media control displays the media specified by the &quot;source&quot; attribute ]
    in the appropriate media player. If a particular media player is desired, it can be specified using the
    &quot;player&quot; attribute. The media control attempts to intelligently handle two tricky aspects of
    cross-platform media display--determining the best player to display the media, and sizing the media player.

    <tr:outputText value="The media component supports two approaches to sizing the media control setting the
        &quot;width&quot; and &quot;height&quot; attributes, which specify the amount of space reserved on the user
        agent for the media control, and setting the &quot;innerWidth&quot; and &quot;innerHeight&quot; attributes,
        which specify the size of the media resource content. Since it is almost impossible to determine the correct
        width and height to use across different players and different player control configurations, specifying the
        &quot;innerWidth&quot; and &quot;innerHeight&quot; is the recommended strategy. "/>

    <tr:outputText value="If the size of the media control isn't specified by one of the above approaches, a default
        inner size, determined by the content type of the media resource, will be used. This works well for audio
        content, but can cause content to be clipped or occupy too much space for video content."/>
