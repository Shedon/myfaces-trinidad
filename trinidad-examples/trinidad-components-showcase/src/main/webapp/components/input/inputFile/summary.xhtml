    The inputFile component is a component that can be used to upload a file. Any Trinidad
    form that contains this component must have usesUpload set to true. The &quot;value&quot; property of an
    inputFile component will be set to an instance of the org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.UploadedFile  class
    when a file is uploaded (with the appropriate ValueChangeEvent delivered.) Before using this, developers must
    install the Apache Trinidad filter.
