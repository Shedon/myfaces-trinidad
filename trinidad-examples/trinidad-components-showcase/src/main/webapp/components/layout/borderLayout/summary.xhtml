    The panelBorderLayout component is a layout element which lays
    out all of its children consecutively in its middle, and supports twelve other facets: top, bottom, left, right,
    start and end. Clients should use only one of left/right or start/end for each side, in any one container, but if both are used,
    left/right &quot;wins&quot;.
