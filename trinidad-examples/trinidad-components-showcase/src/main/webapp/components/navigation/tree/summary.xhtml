    The Trinidad Tree is used to display data that is structured in a hierarchical format.
    This component supports multiple root elements, and it has a simple user interface (UI) - each element in the
    Tree is appropriately indented to indicate its level in the hierarchy, and is connected to its parent. The
    features of the Tree component include mechanisms for expanding and collapsing portions of the hierarchy. This
    component is not well suited for massive trees, since it does not support any focusing capability.
