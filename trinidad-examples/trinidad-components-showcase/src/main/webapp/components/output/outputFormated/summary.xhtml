    The outputFormatted bean accepts a string in its &quot;value&quot; attribute containing
    a very limited set of HTML markup and outputs formatted results. It is not intended as anything near to a
    generic HTML output engine, and will never be such a bean. Developers needing full HTML output should use
    &lt;f:verbatim  	&gt;  or  	&lt;tr:outputText  	&gt; with escape=&quot;false&quot;.

    <br/>

    What this bean does provide is a limited ability to use a single source for translated or
    user-provided formatted text without further parsing or filtering or dangerous constructs (e.g., Javascript),
    and with some hope of successful output to non-HTML displays. It also supports more attributes than an
    unescaped outputText tag - for example, it supports styleClass.
