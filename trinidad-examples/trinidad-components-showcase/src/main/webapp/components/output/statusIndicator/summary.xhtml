    The The statusIndicator component shows whether the page is busy processing or is ready.
    By default, the component shows predefined icons for both readyand busy state. However, if a facet is specified,
    be it rendered or not, none of the default icon is going to be rendered. That behavior enable an easy emulation
    of GMail behavior by specifying only a busy facet.
