    The Page component is similar to the PanelPage component, except that instead of having
    navigation1, navigation2 and navigation3 facets for adding navigation item information, the user binds a model
    object and a stamp to render these areas. The model object is of type MenuModel. A commandNavigationItem should
    be used as the stamp and placed in the &quot;nodeStamp&quot; facet.
