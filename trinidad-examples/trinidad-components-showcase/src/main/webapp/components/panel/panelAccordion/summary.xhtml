    The panelAccordion control can be used to display a group of contents belonging to a
    showDetailItem. It supports both a one-item-at-a-time mode - the default - or multiple-items-at-a-time.
    The latter can be enabled by setting &quot;discloseMany&quot; to true. Visually, an accordion looks like a
    series of accordion bars, with panels below the bar representing disclosed showDetailItem children.
