    This component lays out a label, children, tip, and associated message. Typically, the
    only child of this component will be an input element of some sort, but as many children as necessary can be
    added. When using panelLabelAndMessage with a Trinidad input component, you should always  set
    simple=&quot;true&quot; on the input component. Non-simple Trinidad input components already effectively have
    all the functionality of panelLabelAndMessage.
