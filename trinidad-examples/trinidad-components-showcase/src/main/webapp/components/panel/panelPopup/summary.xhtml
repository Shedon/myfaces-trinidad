    The panelPopup is used to place ancillary information on a page, made visible via a clickable link (e.g icon or link).

    <br/>

    The text attribute or 'trigger' facet is used to define the clickable area of the page.
    When clicked a floating panel is made visible containing the child components. If the title attribute is present,
    then a title bar (including the title) will be rendered for the popup panel. 

    <br/>

    The position attribute of popupPanel can be used to control the location of the panel when visible.
