    SelectRangeChoiceBar is used to allow the user to select a range of records to display
    among a larger set of records. It allows the user to move back and forth through these records.

    <br/>

    selectRangeChoiceBar renders a Previous button, a choice, and a Next button. The choice contains options for ranges.

    <br/>

    Clicking on either the Previous or Next buttons or selecting an option from the choice will deliver a RangeChangeEvent to the server.
