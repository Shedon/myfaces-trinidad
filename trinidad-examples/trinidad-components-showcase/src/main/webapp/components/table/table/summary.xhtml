    The Trinidad Table is used to display tabular data. It also supports selection (both single and multiple), sorting, record navigation and detail-disclosure.  

    <br/>

    The Trinidad Table component uses a model to access the data in the underlying list. The
    specific model class is org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.CollectionModel. You may also use other model
    instances, e.g., java.util.List , array, and javax.faces.model.DataModel. The Table will automatically convert
    the instance into a CollectionModel.

        visible Trinidad Column component creates a separate column in the Table. For more information see the

    <tr:outputText value="When the list being displayed by a Table is huge, you can enable the Table to break up
        the list into ranges and display a single range at a time. Range controls are provided on the Table to let the
        user scroll to the next range, or to go back to the previous range. If the total size of the list is known, a
        control to let the user jump directly to a particular part of the list is also provided on the Table. Use the
        Table attributes &quot;rows&quot; and &quot;first&quot; to control the range navigation feature. When the user
        changes the range, the Table fires a RangeChangeEvent. "/>
