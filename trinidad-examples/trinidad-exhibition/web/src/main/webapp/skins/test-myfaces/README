This is not a real skin, but a way for developers to change and test the myfaces skin
without having to re-deploy the skin jar over and over again.

To use, execute this command from the trinidad-exhibition working copy directory on a Linux OS:
(cd web/src/main/webapp/skins/test-myfaces/ && \
ln -snf ../../../../../../../../trinidad-skins/myfaces-skin/src/main/resources/META-INF/style/myfaces-desktop.css \
test-myfaces.css) 

Now all changes to this test skin will be made to the real one.
